## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
<p>  We have to educate farmers about the soil,water,plants typrs and there needs etc... but we can't educate every farmers by going directly and telling about this and all,so we can use a ai technology to educate them freely and efficiently. Using ai not only we can educate them but we can also clear their doubts.This idea also came to many of the programmers and one of them created a ai technology called Agri-Sahayak to slove these problem .Its a multilingual ,AI powered advisory platform designed to help small farmers by educating and clarifying theri doubts.it also has voice command to be used even by a low-literate users.it can also tell what disease the plant has and halp you to cure the disease. this AI is spcialized  to check the soil if it is ok to plant the seeds in it,or it can also tell you what type of seed you can plant in that soil.you can upload images to check wheather the plant is growing goood or not.Through this even a small framer can farm and get good yeilds.</p>

## Technical Approach
<p>Technologies used here are combined AI/ML model,mobile app development,and Iot integeration</p>

## Feasibility and Viability

<p>While developing a smart crop advisory system for small farmers is a great idea, it faces significant feasibility challenges. A key challenge is the digital divide, where many small farmers lack smartphones, reliable internet access, or the digital literacy needed to use a complex app. Another major risk is the accuracy and hyper-localization of data. The system's recommendations heavily depend on precise, real-time data for specific fields, which can be hard to collect and model accurately across diverse microclimates and soil types. Additionally, there are data privacy concerns, as farmers may be hesitant to share sensitive information about their land and practices. Overcoming these hurdles requires a multi-pronged approach. To address the digital divide, the solution should include low-tech alternatives like SMS-based alerts or a voice-based IVR system. To improve data accuracy, the system could incorporate community-based data collection where local agricultural officers or trusted community members help verify and input data. Finally, to build trust and address privacy, the platform must have robust data security measures and transparent policies on how farmer data is used, ensuring it only serves to provide better advisories. By proactively addressing these challenges, the project can increase its chances of successful implementation and genuine impact.</p>

## Impact and Benefits

<p> Using this ai samll farmers can survive in this world.Even pepole in house can use this ai to grow household plant.Can get more yeild compared to wwhat they get without knowing how to even plant seeds.
Because of getting more yeilds the price of the veggies and fruits decrease,so that people will begin to buy more veggies and fruits.Using ai and following its instruction can reduce usage of fertilizers 
and pesticides making the plant healthy .Therefore heakth of the people will increase who eat these healthy products,if people become healthier the nation's death and disease rate will began to decrease. </p>
